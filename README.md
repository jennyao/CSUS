QuickFindUF.java

The purpose is to create a simulation on whether express checkout lines would help or not in a grocery store. 
There were four test cases used: no express line, an express line with 10 item limit, an express line with 15 item limit, and an express line with 20 item limit.

MTFindMin.c

to compile: g++ -O3 MTFfindMin.c -lpthread -o MTFindMin

This program generates a large array of random numbers which then searches for the minimum number in the array using the different schemes described below.
First Scheme: The parent waits for all children.
Second Scheme: The parent keeps checking on the children in a busy waiting loop and terminates as soon as one child finds a zero or when all children have completed scanning their divisions. The parent must then cancel all threads.
Third Scheme: The parent waits on a semaphore that gets signaled by one of the children either when that child finds a zero or when it detects that all children have completed scanning their divisions. The parent must then cancel all threads.



CPUSchedulerSimulator

This simulates the following CPU scheduling algorithms all while assuming a single CPU
Round Robin (RR), Shortest Job First (SJF), Priority Scheduling without Preemption (PR_noPREMP), Priority Scheduling with Preemption (PR_withPREMP)

VMSimulator

This simulates a simple virtual memory system using page replacement policies: First-In First Out (FIFO), Optimal, and Least Recently Used (LRU)
